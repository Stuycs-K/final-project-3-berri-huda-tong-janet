## Janet Tong

### 5/23 

worked on the the getDirect() method

### 5/28

Session 1: testing getDirect() and move() --> temporary draw() method 
written, tests aren't working too well 

Session 2: wrote HitWall() so it reflects properly, added magnitudes to 
getDirect() and works as intended by the laws of physics ! 

Session 3: configured the triangle of balls, more testing 

### 5/29 

Session 1 in class: wrote contact() --> checks if the balls are in contact 
with eachother and performs collisions as necessary, however having some 
problems 


### 5/30 

Rewrote getDirect() because was incorrect before --> split into getStationaryDirect() and 
getMovingDirect() 

Began working on friction 

Need to figure out how to make sure hitWall() is timed correctly 

### 5/31 

wrote initializeBalls() and arranged the balls accordingly 

### 6/2 

continued testing with the ball collisions, running into trouble with colliding with 2+ balls 

wrote inHole() 

### 6/3 

began working on cueBall repositioning 

### 6/4 

completed cueBall repositioning, WIN/LOSS messages created based on result 
with black ball, created "demo" keys, debugging
