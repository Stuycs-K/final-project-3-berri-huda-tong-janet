## Overview
Our project is a simulation of 8ball/billiards, a game in which one uses a stick to ONLY hit a "cue" ball (the white ball), which in turn can move other balls across a board and into their designated holes.  Many physics forces are at play, including ball collisions, momentum, friction, and more, aspects of which are all included in our project. With this, different levels of force can be exerted on the stick/balls and result in different outcomes in positioning, creating so many outcomes of our game. 

## Instructions

To activate the stick, press your mouse. Moving ur mouse around (not dragging!) will allow you to control the angle at which the stick hits the cue ball. Pressing your mouse again will allow you to secure this angle. If you'd like to change your stick configuration, press your mouse again and changes in orientation are again allowed. 

Once the angle is secured, move your mouse to the sidebar and drag the stick down as much as you would like. The further the stick is dragged down, the more force placed on the stick when hitting the ball. Releasing your mouse after dragging will shoot the ball. 

Repeat this cycle by once again pressing your mouse to reset the location of the stick and play! 

To reset the board, press the key "r". This will return the board to its initial state.
